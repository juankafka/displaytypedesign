<h4 id="ascentis-typeface-project">Ascentis Typeface Project</h4>
<p>Ascentis falls in the realm of display typefaces inspired by Neoclassical typography, sprinkled with a contemporary twist. The serifs and contrast between thick and thin strokes pays its respects to Neoclassical typography. Yet the experimental star-shaped terminals offers a stinging sensation; and the intense, deep curvatures allows the letterforms to melt into their respective spaces. This seamless fusion of sharp and smooth, historical and modern, creates an emphasized edge to Ascentisâ€™ fluidity and unconventional character. Ascentis not only visually acknowledges the history of Typography, but also pushes the boundaries of what typographic conventions can be.</p>
