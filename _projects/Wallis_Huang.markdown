#### Rollick Display Typeface Project ####
Rollick Display is a high-contrast sans serif font that's built off a traditional structure but boldly seeks for unconventional forms. A tilt in axis and the iconic complex curve create a continuous flow and rhythm to the letterforms when they are used in context. It will be great for both printed matter and digital surface.
