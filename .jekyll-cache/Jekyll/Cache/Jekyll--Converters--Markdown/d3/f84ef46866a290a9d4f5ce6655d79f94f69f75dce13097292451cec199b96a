Blaub is an exaggeration of a personal lettering style that plays with sharp and soft, mass and void, and the movement of the hand.
<br /><br />
Rather than working within strict systemization, elongated rationalism, and argument, this project was driven through a back and forth of bodily responses: the thinking/sketching hand, judging eye, and emotional reaction and delight.

<p>Vanna Vu draws words and designs type, as it means they get to contribute to the material of written language and learn through intersections of culture, history, technology, craft, etc. They are a first-generation Vietnamese American sometimes-freelancer grocery store worker originally from Bentonville, Arkansas who moved to Minneapolis after finishing their BFA in Communication Design from Washington University in St. Louis in 2019. They will probably become some sort of designer-writer-archivist-educator, eventually.
