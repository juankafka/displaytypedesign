## Razor ##
### by Mariana Navarro ###

<br>
Razor is a typeface that brings together everything I love about letters. With its calligraphic strokes and sharp serifs, that looks almost too dangerous if one could touch them. It has a bold personality that’s both fierce and elegant. Designed during the Display Type Course at Type Electives, Razor is a reflection of my evergrowing passion for the art of letters.

<br>

Exploration through calligraphy with the flat brush has been the basis of Razor's creative process. Understanding and discovering the shapes and strokes that can emerge from handling the tool on the paper, in an attempt to combine different styles and play with some proportions, formed the personality of this typeface.
