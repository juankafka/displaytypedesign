## Egredi ##
### by Alex Durlak ###

<br>
Egredi is an experimental, bold display typeface for headlines and titles that embodies its name: a Latin verb meaning "to step out", "disembark" or "to go beyond". It lives up to its promise with angular letterforms inspired by broad-nib pen strokes and refined through a geometric, grid-based modular system. Its structure is deliberate, yet subtle calligraphic gestures break through the rigidity. Each form, like its namesake, “deviates” and “ascends” from convention, resulting in a distinctively progressive, forward-leaning aesthetic.
