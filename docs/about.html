Over a period of ten weeks, a group of talented and highly motivated students from all over the world gathered in a virtual classroom to learn from one another and push their design skills further fueled by a shared passion for type.
<br /><br /></p>
<h3 id="what-can-display-type-teach-us-about-the-current-moment">What can display type teach us about the current moment?</h3>
<p><br />
Display type is designed to make an unapologetic statement. It can be elegant and bold, and speaks to us loud and clear without holding back. Simply put, display type wears its heart on its sleeve.</p>

<p>In a world where marginalized voices are silenced, undermined, and ignored, speaking up against injustice and building up the confidence to simply be oneself is a courageous act.</p>

<p>In this class, we embraced the messiness of history, the plurality of stories, and the power that type and typography have to make our own unique voices present and visible.</p>

<p>Drawing on their vast range of interests both related and unrelated to type, the students infused their work with their personality while learning the practical skills needed to navigate the constraints of designing a system of letters.</p>

<p>Each student, through their own diverse perspectives and backgrounds, shared with us a world of possibilities and multiple approaches for studying, designing, and thinking about what display type is, has been, but most importantly, what it could be.</p>

<p>The result is a beautiful group of typefaces each with their own personality, speaking in their own voice, moving at their own rhythm, and tuned to their own tone.</p>

<p>As the instructor of this class, Iâ€™m incredibly humbled and proud of the work you see here as it shows a lot of potential, growth, and a fresh take on the various forms that display type can have.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this class exhibit and I encourage you to check out more of the studentsâ€™ work, follow them on social media, and hire them for your next type-based project.
