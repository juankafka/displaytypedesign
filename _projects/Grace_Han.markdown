## Enrapture ##
### by Grace Han ###

<br>
Enrapture is a translation-contrast, italic, connecting script typeface. The forms reference script typefaces made from the first half of the 1900s, as well as the designer's own handwriting with the broad-nib pen. The typeface is meant to convey a sense of speed, urgency, and the hand. Ideal use cases include: love poems, passionate manifestos, and confessions to your crush.

<br>
I originally was solving for a completely different brief. At the beginning of class, I wanted to create a typeface that was both calligraphic and dimensional. Through researching script forms and construction, I fell in love with making a typeface that was informed more by handwriting. It led to shapes that felt more personal and a new challenge of understanding how to to make each character connect.
