## Parsimonia ##
### by Denisse Orea ###

<br>
Parsimonia is inspired by by manual arts. It wants to evoke the idea of doing things calmly and carefully. Use organic elements from nature (such as the aesthetics of arts and crafts).
«Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished» –Lao Tzu.

"The Parsimonia process was very baroque. It went through many decisions and comments to synthesize the ornaments and standardize their parts. 
Ornaments that simulate leaves are essential to resemble the elements that characterize Art Nouveau.
Still in progress…"
