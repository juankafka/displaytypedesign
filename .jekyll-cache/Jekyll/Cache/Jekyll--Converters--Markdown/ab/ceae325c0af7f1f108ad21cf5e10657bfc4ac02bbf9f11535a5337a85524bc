The beautiful display typefaces in this gallery were designed by a group of talented and motivated students during a 10-week <a href="http://coopertype.org/event/principles_of_typeface_design_display_type_2020">Display Type Design</a> class at Type@Cooper under the instruction of <a href="http://www.juankafka.com/">Juan Villanueva</a>
<br /><br />
If you like the work, I encourage you to check out their websites, follow them on social media, and maybe hire them for your next type-based project ;)
<br /><br />
If youâ€™re interested in learning type design, I encourage to take my <a href="http://coopertype.org/workshops/nyc/nyc">Principles of Typeface Design: Display Type</a> class through Type@Cooper or any of the other excellent workshops offered in their program.
<br /><br />
If youâ€™re studying type design or want to improve, I enourage you to check out the <a href="https://medium.com/typecritcrew">Type Crit Crew</a> an intiative that I started to connect type designs students with experienced type designers.
