## Aseo Romano ##
### by Oscar Saylor ###

<br>
With its diagonal angles, approachability, humanistic character, comfort, and elegance, Aseo Romano is a typeface that draws inspiration from aspects of Cooper, Windsor, and Souvenir. Aseo is a tight word spacing font designed for clothing, album covers, and print headlines. The dramatic angles inside the counter forms and the long serifs make this typeface unique.

<br>
While thinking of what typeface I wanted to create, I reflected that my main goal was to learn, so I wanted something challenging. This led me to use translation as my axis base. Translation has a sense of rhythm, and to keep the distraction from uncomfortable negative spacing within two tightly spaced letters or when serifs touch, I had to use angles to keep the harmony.
