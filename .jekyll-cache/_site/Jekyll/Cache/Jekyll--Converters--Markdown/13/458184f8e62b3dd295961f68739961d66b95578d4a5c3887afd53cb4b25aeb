<p><br />
Ginga is a casual display type full of rhythm and passion. It was born inspired by typographic styles found in the streets Brazil: produced by hand and commonly used on signs. The main focus was to reinterpret some of their unique characteristics in order to create a modern and approachable typeface. This should not be a literal revival, but something new inspired by a vernacular art form.
<br /><br />
Ginga started as a high contrast type inspired by some specific signs created with markers and slowly evolved to incorporate characteristics of other references that brought more movement to the letters.
