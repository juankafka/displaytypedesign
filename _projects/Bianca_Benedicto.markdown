Oniresi is a display typeface designed to suit and celebrate the specificities of the Yoruba (Èdé Yorùbá) language.

<br>
This typeface begun with a desire and ended with more questions and open roads to follow. In the middle of my research, about the language, I found another project called PanNigerian that was idealized in the 80's by professor Victor Manfredi and developed with the help of Hermann Zapf. Back then, the idea was to create one unified character map for typewriters and typesetting that contemplates all written official languages of Nigeria (English, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa).

As i wanted to bring this project a little bit closer to my reality, my goal was o apply a critical view by approaching Zapf's drawings with another mindset and current communication needs, like non-binary special characters. To have a modernized version of this important typeface, which has characters ignored by Unicode and that could benefit more than 20 million people. This project is not a revival but an attempt to take another possible path based on the things we don't want to perpetuate anymore.
