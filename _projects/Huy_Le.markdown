## Fatty ##
### by Huy Le ###

<br>
Fatty is inspired by Huy’s appreciation for ball terminals. Alongside the “field” of ball terminals, the typeface’s uppercase set is designed to be pushed to the extreme. By studying forms from 1800s–1900s calligraphy and specimen books, the caps reveal a strong connection to cursive forms with swashes. Overall, the combination results in an ultra-organic typeface that contains many unexpected forms.
