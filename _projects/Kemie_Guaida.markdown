## Kurbits ##
### by Kemie Guaida ###

<br>
Inspired by the ornate forms and brushstrokes of Mexican & Scandinavian folk art, Kurbits — named after a swedish word for flourishes — is a different take on tuscan typefaces. The result is a high contrast, bold typeface for display & branding.
<br><br>
Kurbits ended up being somewhere in between a didone and a traditional tuscan face. It was a challenge to figure out a system where the ornaments would make sense, and be exhuberant but not overwhelming.
