## Hedie ##
### by Sandra Morales ###
<br>
Hedie is a dynamic stencil typeface, featuring reverse contrast and an italic style. This combination provides a flowing and striking look, perfect for bold and eye-catching designs.

<br>
Inspired by The Women of Photo-Lettering from the One Line Manual of Styles (1971) and phototypesetting technology, Hedie is an exploration of what contemporary typeface descended from those styles and that technology might look like. Typecookers were my best friends in finding what I found fun to turn into a system; inverted contrast, stencil, and italic slant were my ingredients.
