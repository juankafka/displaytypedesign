## Pumako ##
### by Mathew Prada ###

<br>
Typeface inspired in early 1800s slab serifs, merged with the essence of local ancient ruins (Puma Punku). The result is a very sturdy display font with high squareness, clear cuts and robust asymmetric serifs.
<br><br>
For most of the process, the challenge was to balance between neutral and expressive, trying to keep square shapes and sharpness but always thinking about realistic usability.
