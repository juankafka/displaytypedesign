## Purrrgatorio ##
### by Laura Ramírez ###
<br>
Purrrgatorio is a display typeface for rebel felines who wish to speak truth to power.

Inspired by my cats, my neighborhood, my friends and my ideals, I intended to create a typeface that took me out of my preconceived notions about legibility into a more contemporary, psychedelic and dark visual territory. I hope it can be used in zines, pamphlets, posters, stickers, apparel and many other hegemony-challenging projects.
