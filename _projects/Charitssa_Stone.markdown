## Cornrow ##
### by Charitssa Stone ###

<br>
Cornrow is a back-slant, reverse-high-contrast display typeface inspired by the artistry and intricacies of Black hairstyles, specifically cornrows. My overall goal was to highlight the flexibility and interpretive nature of typography as a medium, serving as a vehicle for cultural representation, all while staying away from any literal interpretations of a braid. Instead of directly adopting the braiding pattern into letterforms in the design process, I focused more on how type can emulate cornrows and looked at other nuanced elements such as hair parting, as well as the direction and flow of braids in cornrows.
