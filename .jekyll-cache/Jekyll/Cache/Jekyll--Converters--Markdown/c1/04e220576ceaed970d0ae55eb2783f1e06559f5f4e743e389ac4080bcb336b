<h3 id="balsa-display-typeface">Balsa Display Typeface</h3>

<p>Balsa is inspired by old-fashioned wood type. I wanted to create a typeface that has a hand carved feeling to it without sacrificing readability in screen use. I also wanted to bring wood type into the 21st century, but in a fun, casual way– not stiff or stern feeling.</p>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>I began by researching examples of fonts that qualified as wood type– but most of them felt stiff and outdated, or not appropriate for casual use. I then came up with a few directions and landed on the most soft-feeling. This was partially inspired by balsa wood: not only the softest commercial type of wood, but also a Spanish word for “raft” because of its buoyancy and strength. I researched balsa wood and its attributes, which helped lead me to the final product: a casual typeface full of curves that still evokes the wood type style of the 1800s.
