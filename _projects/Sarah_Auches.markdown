## Suyeko ##
### by Sarah Auches ###

<br>
Suyeko is a sans serif, italic typeface that takes cues from handwriting. It aims to make text feel warm, soft, and digestible for readers. 

The idea for Suyeko came from a small collection of my grandma’s post-its and handwritten recipe notes that I had taken photos of over the years. Her everyday handwriting feels casual and straightforward but retains remnants of the more fluid cursive forms that she grew up writing. My grandma and the histories she embodies mean so much to me, so I wanted the process of working on this typeface to feel personal and get at questions about designing with memory and preservation in mind.

The process of designing Suyeko was a lot of push and pull. The semi-cursive characteristics of my grandma’s writing brought up a lot of questions: will it have more open or incomplete forms similar to some script styles? What elements make this feel more formal, or less? What choices capture the character and warmth of her writing even if they don’t mimic its literal construction? 

Answering these questions for myself was a rewarding challenge and the forms that emerged aren’t what I expected but capture the feeling I had hoped they would. Thank you to Juan, Corinne, Bea, and all my wonderful classmates who guided me and kept me motivated to see where this would go!
