    <p>This gallery website is managed by <a href="https://lynneyun.com">Lynne Yun</a> for all her past students. I hope you will be inspired by their work, follow their progress on the socials, and even hire them for a project or two!</p>

<p>I have a monthly newsletter that I send out with updates about upcoming talks, classes, current topics of research, and of course updates to this site. <a href="https://t.co/xP4XSb9ITu?amp=1">Sign up</a> if youâ€™d like to be in the loop.</p>

<p>This page is part of a series of galleries. See <a href="https://generativetype.com/">Generative Typography</a> for more student work!</p>
