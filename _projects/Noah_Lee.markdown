## Nazbas ##
### by Noah Lee ###

<br>
Nazbas is a typeface inspired by the Puebloan pottery of the North American Southwest tribes. Instead of direct influence I felt it was necessary to instead follow the trail of environmental motivation. The area these tribes call home are carved in stone with layers and swirls of sandstone. I made this to be used with pottery events, shows, workshops and tribal associated material as there are few authentic Indigenous North American typefaces.

The way I came to my conclusion was by experimenting with a dual stroke construction along the stems and bowls of the characters. The challenges this construction brought are with color consistency and continuity with capital letters.
