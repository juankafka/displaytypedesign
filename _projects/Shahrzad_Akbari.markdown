## GUSTAVKISS ##
### by Shahrzad Akbari ###

<br>
My typeface is based on ""The Kiss"" Painting by Gustav Klimt, which I'm so obsessed with.There are analyzes of this painting that I want my typeface to be the same. A combination of this couple. Straight and serious lines alongside with round lines and tender feelings. Together in a delightful harmony. You can use this typeface where you want to express a little of both of these feelings. It's for titles. While it's currently all-caps, lowercase letters are on the horizon.

<br>
In the design process, I decided to implement the intricate intimacy of the couple in the painting, in my typeface. By daringly placing distance where none should exist, within the letters of P, B, R and the digits of 6 and 9, I conveyed the true absence of distance between two enamored souls.
