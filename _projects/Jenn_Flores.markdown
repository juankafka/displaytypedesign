## Maki ##
### by Jenn Flores ###

<br>
Maki, a typeface crafted in memory of my 19-year-old dog, draws inspiration from his unique quirks. His long tongue and tail influence elongated shapes, and upward curves reflect his playful nature. Sharp edges are inspired by his distinct personality, mirroring his teeth sharpness. The reversed contrast translation model adds sophistication, featuring exaggerated elongation and sharp corners. This intricate blend of design elements pays homage to a beloved companion, transforming his essence into a visually captivating and meaningful typeface.
