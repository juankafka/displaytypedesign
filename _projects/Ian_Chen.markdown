## Norma ##
### by Ian Chen ###

<br>
The original brief was to design a sans-serif typeface with a fluid, organic feel. While walking around the city, I started paying more attention to road markings and how they quietly shape city's visual environment.

That observation led to Norma, a reverse-contrast, condensed typeface inspired by the visual language of city streets. It features softened counterspaces and smooth, fluid transitions, bringing a more expressive and human quality to something that’s usually very functional.
