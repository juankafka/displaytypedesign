### Thank you for stopping by! ###
<br>
The beautiful display typefaces in this gallery were designed by a group of talented and motivated students during a 10-week [Display Type Design](http://coopertype.org/event/principles_of_typeface_design_display_type_2020) class at Type@Cooper under the instruction of [Juan Villanueva](http://www.juankafka.com/).
<br><br>
I encourage you to check out the designer's work, follow them on social media, and consider hiring them for your next type-based project ;)
<br><br>
Inspired by what you see? I invite you to take my [Principles of Typeface Design: Display Type](http://coopertype.org/workshops/nyc/nyc) class through Type@Cooper or any of the other excellent workshops offered in their program.
<br><br>
If you're studying type design or want to improve, I enourage you to check out the [Type Crit Crew](https://medium.com/typecritcrew) an intiative that I started to connect type designs students with experienced type designers.
