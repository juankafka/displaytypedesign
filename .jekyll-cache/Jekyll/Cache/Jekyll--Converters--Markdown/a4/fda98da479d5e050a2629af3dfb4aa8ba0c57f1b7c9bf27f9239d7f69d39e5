The goal was to create a modular typeface that answered the proposed brief and looked like a system. I hope the typeface would breath itsâ€™ own tone of voice and sophistication that can allow it to be used through multiple audiences and channels.
<br /><br />
The process started with sketching and tracing on paper, figuring out where the thick and thin of the forms would be. Additionally, would be doing research and analyzing the way of writing with a brush and studying the hiragana characters.

<p>This display typeface introduces a synthesis between two typefaces (Times New Roman Condensed Bold) and (Matisse EB, hiragana font.) It was interesting to explore the connections between a transitional serif and an expression bold Japanese brush inspired typeface.
