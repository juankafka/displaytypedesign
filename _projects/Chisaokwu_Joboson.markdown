## Gidigbo Display ##
### by Chisaokwu Joboson ###

<br>
Gidigbo is an experimental display typeface by Chisaokwu Joboson inspired by the Yoruba traditional wrestling from which it takes its name. The goal was to imagine a typeface with its letters punched in on both sides, thus resulting to concave stems. This typeface celebrates African culture and serves as a statement towards the underrepresentation of Africans in the type design industry as well as the possibilities African typography has to offer in the world of type.
