This gallery website is managed by [Lynne Yun](https://lynneyun.com) for all her past students. I hope you will be inspired by their work, follow their progress on the socials, and even hire them for a project or two! 

I have a monthly newsletter that I send out with updates about upcoming talks, classes, current topics of research, and of course updates to this site. [Sign up](https://t.co/xP4XSb9ITu?amp=1) if you'd like to be in the loop.

This page is part of a series of galleries. See [Generative Typography](https://generativetype.com/) for more student work!
