## Sake ##
### by Marcus Soniat ###

<br>
Manga has played a huge role in my imagination growing up. Ultimately, I wanted to produce a font that was a love letter to those memories. Sake is a condensed sans serif that takes inspiration from ninjas within the context of manga, particularly from the Naruto series. I chose this series because it was one of my first introductions into manga. I fell in love with the art and characters and how cool they portrayed no matter the circumstance.

I tried various calligraphic expressions. My sketches in the beginning were very stylized without much direction. My break through came when I focused on reading manga and the letter forms that kept popping up within that context. That helped me refine my brief for the font the most.
